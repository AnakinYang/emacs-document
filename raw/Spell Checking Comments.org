I'm notorious for all the typos I make. Thankfully Emacs features an awesome built-in mode named =flyspell= to help poor typists like me.
Flyspell highlights misspelled words as you type (a.k.a. on the fly) and has useful keybindings to quickly fix them.

Most people typically enable =flyspell= only for major modes derived from =text-mode= (e.g. =markdown-mode=, =adoc-mode=), but it can really help programmers as well by
pointing out typos they make in comments. All you need to do is enable =flyspell-prog-mode=. I typically enable it for all programming modes like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'flyspell-prog-mode)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now you'll get instant feedback when you make some typo in a
comment. To fix a word just press =C-c $= (=M-x flyspell-correct-word-before-point=), while your cursor is behind it.

That's all I have for you today! Keep fixing those nasty typos!
