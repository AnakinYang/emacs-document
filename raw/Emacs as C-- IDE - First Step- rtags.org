For years, I have been battling hard to find an optimal setup on my Emacs. Finally, after sufficient *patience* I think I have found a tags setup that is not too crufty to navigate. I have visited [[https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags][rtags home page]] for long enough, I even watched [[https://github.com/atilaneves/cmake-ide][the famous cmake-ide evangelist's video]] but never really figured out how to get my Emacs to behave with rtags.

Now, what I am doing requires to navigate a large C++ codebase like nobody's business and things were getting serious. So, I decided to spend the weekend looking closely into this.

At first, I wanted everything to work out of the box then I realized this was a pipe dream so I started the rdm server from terminal and ran the indexer from command line too (Gross!)

However, after enough digging and sifting through the following links here I have a working out of the box rtags/cmake-ide setup. I'm sharing the final output here. I am running Emacs 26.1 compiled from source.

First clone the rtags repo inside your =~/.emacs.d= directory and build the repo based on the instructions provided in the [[https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags][rtags home page]]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (require 'rtags)
  (cmake-ide-setup)
  (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'rtags-start-process-unless-running)
  (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'rtags-start-process-unless-running)

  (use-package rtags
   :ensure t
   :hook (c++-mode . rtags-start-process-unless-running)
   :config (setq rtags-completions-enabled t
          rtags-path "/home/manoj/.emacs.d/rtags/src/rtags.el"
          rtags-rc-binary-name "/home/manoj/.emacs.d/rtags/bin/rc"
          rtags-use-helm t
          rtags-rdm-binary-name "/home/manoj/.emacs.d/rtags/bin/rdm")
   :bind (("C-c E" . rtags-find-symbol)
       ("C-c e" . rtags-find-symbol-at-point)
       ("C-c O" . rtags-find-references)
       ("C-c o" . rtags-find-references-at-point)
       ("C-c s" . rtags-find-file)
       ("C-c v" . rtags-find-virtuals-at-point)
       ("C-c F" . rtags-fixit)
       ("C-c f" . rtags-location-stack-forward)
       ("C-c b" . rtags-location-stack-back)
       ("C-c n" . rtags-next-match)
       ("C-c p" . rtags-previous-match)
       ("C-c P" . rtags-preprocess-file)
       ("C-c R" . rtags-rename-symbol)
       ("C-c x" . rtags-show-rtags-buffer)
       ("C-c T" . rtags-print-symbol-info)
       ("C-c t" . rtags-symbol-type)
       ("C-c I" . rtags-include-file)
       ("C-c i" . rtags-get-include-file-for-symbol)))

  (setq rtags-display-result-backend 'helm)
