Another week, another trick. For this week, I wanted to give you an overview of my organization with the =org-mode= to be in continuity with the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/98nkt6/tip_how_do_i_synchronize_my_org_files_with_my/][previous tip]].
又一个星期，又一个诡计。这周，我想给大家介绍一下我的组织的概况，使用=org-mode=来延续[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/98nkt6/tip_how_do_i_synchronize_my_org_files_with_my/][以前的技巧]]。

*NOTE:* there's no code on this post, since I don't have anything magical to present. Also, I know that a lot of posts already exist about how to be organized with =org-mode=, but I figured one more wouldn't hurt 😊

First and foremost, you need to know why nowadays it is more important than before to be organized. Well, we live in a world where everything has to go fast while limiting stress and increasing our productivity. We can say that organization is the way we can be productive by saving time, while limiting our stress.
首先，你需要知道为什么现在组织比以前更重要。嗯，我们生活在一个一切都必须快速发展的世界，同时限制压力，提高我们的生产力。我们可以说，组织是我们能够通过节省时间，同时限制我们的压力来提高效率的方法。

Personally, it's been 5 years since I started being organized with =org-mode= and I must admit that it was difficult because we quickly tend to give up when the organization is screwed up for some reason. I started by wanting to be organized because I noticed that the most successful people are organized. This organization is mainly done through time and money management.
就我个人而言，自从我开始组织=org-mode=已经5年了，我必须承认这很困难，因为当组织由于某种原因搞砸时，我们很快就会放弃。我从想要有条理开始，因为我注意到最成功的人都是有条理的。这个组织主要是通过时间和金钱管理来完成的。

Even if I am not always satisfied with the level I have to manage my organization, when I look at the person I was 5 years ago, I am pleased to have made efforts to improve it. Remember that your time is your most valuable asset.
即使我并不总是对自己管理公司的水平感到满意，但当我看到5年前的自己时，我很高兴自己做出了努力来提高它。记住，你的时间是你最宝贵的资产。

That being said, it is important that you know yourself before you want to start an organization that you will not respect.
也就是说，在你想要建立一个你不会尊重的组织之前，了解自己是很重要的。

The questions you should ask yourself are the following:
你应该问自己以下问题:

1. How much sleep do I need to not feel tired?
1. 我需要睡多久才不会觉得累?

2. Am I more of a morning or evening person?
2. 我是属于早起的人还是晚起的人?

3. How much time can I concentrate on a task?
3.我能在一项任务上集中多少时间?

4. Why would I want to improve my organization?
4. 我为什么想要改善我的组织?

Once you have those answers, then you can organize your schedule around that.
一旦你有了这些答案，你就可以围绕它来安排你的日程。

For the setup of my organization in =org-mode=, here are the people on whom I take inspiration and that I suggest you:
对于在=org-mode=中设置我的组织，以下是我从他们身上获得灵感的人，我建议你:

- Sacha Chua;
-蔡美儿;

- alphapapa;
——alphapapa;

- Nicolas Petton;
-尼古拉斯Petton;

- John Wiegley.
约翰·维格里

In addition to that, I tend to follow [[https://www.youtube.com/user/electrickeye91][Thomas Frank]]'s advices like writing 3 evening tasks to do for the next day and tidying up our workspace every night so that it is already operational.
除此之外，我倾向于遵循[[https://www.youtube.com/user/electrickeye91][托马斯·弗兰克]]的建议，比如写3个晚上的任务来完成第二天的工作，每天晚上整理一下我们的工作空间，这样它就已经可以工作了。

From a file structure point of view, here is what I use:
从文件结构的角度来看，我用的是:

- *agenda*: includes all files related to =org-agenda=.
- *agenda*:包括与=org-agenda=相关的所有文件。

These files are as follows:
这些文件如下:

1. =calendar.org=: contains events related to special days. In short, this file contains =%%(org-calendar-holiday)= to display special event days and =%%(org-contacts-anniversaries)= to display my contacts' birthdays.
1. =calendar.org=:包含与特殊日子相关的事件。简而言之，这个文件包含=%%(org-calendar-holiday)=显示特殊事件日，=%%(org-contacts-纪念日)=显示联系人的生日。

2. =contacts.org=: contains the details of my contacts ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8toivy/tip_how_to_manage_your_contacts_with_orgcontacts/][read more on this subject]]). For the headers used, I use: Business, Family, Family Friends and Friends.
2. =contacts.org=:包含我的联系人的详细信息([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8toivy/tip_how_to_manage_your_contacts_with_orgcontacts/][阅读更多关于这个主题的信息]])。对于使用的标题，我使用:业务，家庭，家庭朋友和朋友。

3. =organizer.org=: contains the entries from tasks that need to be refile. I try as much as possible that every week, this file is empty of tasks. For the headers used, I use: Tasks and When...
3.=organizer.org=:包含来自需要重新填充的任务的条目。我尽可能多的尝试，每个星期，这个文件是空的任务。对于使用的标题，我使用:Tasks和When…

4. =people.org=: contains the entries from people-related tasks. For the headers used, I use: Family, Family Friends, Friends, Meetups, Tasks.
4. =people.org=:包含与人相关的任务的条目。对于使用的标题，我使用:家庭，家庭朋友，朋友，聚会，任务。

5. =review.org=: contains weekly and monthly reviews. My reviews mainly consist in rereading the daily entries of my journal and completing them with a report made by =org-clock-report= in order to note my productivity (e.g. by noting the time spent to study, personal projects, playing, watch series, etc.). *NOTE:* one of my desires, is to be able to draw a circle graph generated with =TikZ= in =LaTeX= which would take the column names present in the table and display in percentage the time spent on each task in order to have a visual aspect ([[http://www.texample.net/media/tikz/examples/PNG/pie-chart-color.png][something like shown here]]). If any of you have an idea to do that, I would be very interested 😊

6. =routine.org=: contains my daily tasks. For the headers used, I use: Every day, Once a week, Once a month, Once a quarter, Once a year and When...
6. =routine.org=:包含我的日常任务。对于使用的标题，我使用:每天一次，每周一次，每月一次，每个季度一次，每年一次，当……

7. =school.org=: contains the entries from school-related tasks. *NOTE:* this file is temporary, since I'm still a student. It will be replaced by =work.org= once I have a permanent work.
7. =school.org=:包含来自学校相关任务的条目。*注意:*这个文件是临时的，因为我还是一个学生。一旦我有了固定的工作，它将被=work.org=代替。

- *archives*: includes the task archives of my =org= files. I try to archive every week to avoid polluting my =org= files with finished tasks and that I no longer intend to pay attention to it.
*archives*:包括我的=org= files的任务存档。我试图每周存档，以避免污染我的=org=文件与完成的任务，我不再打算关注它。

The archiving structure I currently use is as follows:
我目前使用的归档结构如下:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
- 2018
- organizer.org_archive
- people.org_archive
- review.org_archive
- school.org_archive
...
#+END_EXAMPLE

However, I would like to change to something more structured as follows:
然而，我想改变一些更有结构的如下:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
- 2018
- january
- week1
- organizer.org_archive
- people.org_archive
- review.org_archive
- school.org_archive
...
...
...
#+END_EXAMPLE

- *courses*: includes =org= files related to my courses. I tend to create one large =org= file per course. The reason why I prefer to use =org= for my classes is that I write faster with a keyboard than with a pen.
*课程*:包括=org=与我的课程相关的文件。我倾向于为每个课程创建一个大型的=org=文件。我喜欢使用=org=的原因是我用键盘比用钢笔写得快。

- *journal:* includes =org= files related to =org-journal= ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8kz8dv/tip_how_i_use_orgjournal_to_improve_my/][read more on this subject]]).
- *journal:*包括=org=相关文件=org-journal= ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8kz8dv/tip_how_i_use_orgjournal_to_improve_my/][阅读更多关于这个主题]])。

- *ledger:* includes =org= files related to =ledger= ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8x4xtt/tip_how_i_use_ledger_to_track_my_money/][read more on this subject]]).
- *ledger:*包括=org=相关文件=ledger= ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8x4xtt/tip_how_i_use_ledger_to_track_my_money/][阅读更多关于这个主题]])。

- *other:* includes =org= files that couldn't find their place in the other files (e.g. =books.org=, =learning.org=, etc.)
*other:* include =org=在其他文件中找不到位置的文件(例如=books.org=， =learning.org=，等等)

- *summaries:* includes =org= files which includes summaries on subjects I liked and problem solving (e.g. crypt external hard drive, root phone, etc.).
*摘要:*包括=org=文件，其中包括我喜欢的主题和问题解决的摘要(如crypt外部硬盘驱动器，根电话等)。

*NOTE:* recently, I'm using =git= to do control management with my =org= files. Which helps, if I do a misusing manipulation with my files.
*注意:*最近，我用=git=来管理我的=org=文件。这很有帮助，如果我对我的文件进行了错误的操作。
