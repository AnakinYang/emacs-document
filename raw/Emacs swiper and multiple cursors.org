Emacs [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][swiper]] is awesome. I bound /swiper-isearch/ to /C-s/. Also a big fan of [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple cursors]]. I use it regularly (it's fun).

I had totally missed Ole's post back in 2015: [[https://oremacs.com/2015/10/14/swiper-mc/][A simple multiple-cursors extension to swiper]]. Turns out, swiper has multiple cursors support out of the box (bound to /C-7/ by default). Yay!

UPDATE: Thanks to [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8370][irreal's post]], please remember to add /swiper-mc/ to /mc/cmds-to-run-once/ list (or things won't work as expected). This typically happens interactively when you invoke C-7 the first time around. Make sure you answer "n" when you see a prompt like:

If you happen to choose "y" by mistake, take a look at *~/.emacs.d/.mc-lists.el* to correct it. Remove /swiper-mc/ from /mc/cmds-to-run-for-all/
and add it to /mc/cmds-to-run-once/. Invoke /m-x eval-buffer/ to reset the values and you're good to go.
