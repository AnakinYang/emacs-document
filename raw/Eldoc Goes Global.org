I recently noticed that Emacs 25.1 had added a global variant of the
popular =eldoc-mode=, called =global-eldoc-mode=. What's more -
unlike =eldoc-mode=, =global-eldoc-mode= is enabled by default!

This means that you can get rid of all the code in your Emacs config that was
wiring up =eldoc-mode= for major modes that support it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ;; That code is now redundant
  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'eldoc-mode)
  (add-hook 'ielm-mode-hook #'eldoc-mode)
  (add-hook 'cider-mode-hook #'eldoc-mode)
  (add-hook 'cider-repl-mode-hook #'eldoc-mode)
#+END_EXAMPLE

There are [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/31414/how-to-globally-disable-eldoc][some reports]]
that =global-eldoc-mode= is causing performance issues in modes that
don't support it. I've never experienced this myself, but if you want
to disable it you can simply do so like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (global-eldoc-mode -1)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now it's time to clean up my config! Deleting code always feels so good!
