[[http://mbork.pl/2018-06-10_Git_diff_in_Eshell][Some time ago]], I wrote about a way for programs started in Eshell to use =cat= as a pager instead of =less=. Since originally I only wanted this behavior with Git, and Git has a ==--no-pager= option, it would be better to automatically add that option to Git.

Well, it turns out that Eshell has the feature we know and love in bash: aliases. The only catch is that they work slightly different (in bash you would use an equal sign whereas in Eshell you use a space, and the body of the alias should be in single quotes in Eshell).

So to sum it up, you can say

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    alias git 'git --no-pager $*'
#+END_EXAMPLE

when in Eshell (aliases are saved automatically), and enjoy your new Git experience at once.
