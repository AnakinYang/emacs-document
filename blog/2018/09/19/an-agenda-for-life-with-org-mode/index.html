<p>
I've been promising the Twitterverse that I would write more about how I use Org
Mode to get stuff done and how I use it to be a better manager. Upon careful
reflection, there is too much to cover in just one post, so this is the first of
what will likely be several posts on these topics.
</p>

<p>
Today I would like to focus on the “agenda view” and how I've configured it to
give me a window into what I need to do now, what is on the horizon, and manage
which things I should do first.
</p>

<p>
This is what we'll build:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="file:///images/uploads/an-agenda-for-life-with-org-mode/composite-agenda-view.png" alt="composite-agenda-view.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
I classify all of my activities into one of four buckets:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Things I need to do, eventually;</li>
<li>Things I need to complete by a specific date;</li>
<li>Things I cannot (or won't) start until a specific date; and</li>
<li>Things I should do with some loose frequency.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Each of these use cases aligns with an Org Mode feature, and those features are,
respectively:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A plain TODO entry,</li>
<li>An entry with a SCHEDULED time stamp,</li>
<li>An entry with a DEADLINE time stamp, and</li>
<li>An entry with a STYLE property of “habit.”</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-org994ef16" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="building-the-agenda"><a id="org994ef16"></a>Building the Agenda</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-building-the-agenda">
<p>
I very briefly introduced the agenda in my previous post,
<a href="file:///2016/01/30/dig-into-org-mode.html">Dig into Org Mode</a>. The “agenda” is a time-aware, filtered view of all
of the entries in some set of Org files, which you can specify. To make proper
use of the agenda, you must first tell Org which files to read by configuring
the <code>org-agenda-files</code> variable.
</p>

<p>
As I noted in <a href="file:///2016/01/30/dig-into-org-mode.html">Dig into Org Mode</a>, I build my agenda from all of the Org
files in my “org” directory in Dropbox. Specifying a single directory is the
easiest thing you can do:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq org-agenda-files '("~/Dropbox/org/"))
</pre>

<p>
You can also select individual files or specify a file that contains a list of
files to read. See the variable's documentation for specifics.
</p>

<p>
Once Org knows where to look to build up the agenda view, you can populate it
with your tasks. I'm assuming that you already use Org for note-taking or task
management in some way, but if you don't, here is the bare minimum you should
place into a file to see how this works:
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS | DONE

* TODO Complete this task eventually

* TODO Complete this task by September 30th
 DEADLINE: &lt;2016-09-30 Fri&gt;

* TODO Start this task on September 30th.
 SCHEDULED: &lt;2016-09-30 Fri&gt;
</pre>

<p>
With a file like this saved as something like <code>todo.org</code> in the directory
specified in <code>org-agenda-files</code>, you can now press <code>M-x org-agenda RET</code> to
display the “agenda dispatch” menu. The first option, “a,” is the most common as
it will display a weekly view with entries sorted into their respective dates.
</p>

<p>
You may have noticed that the “agenda dispatch” menu contains options for
displaying views based on dates, views of pure TODO items, and even views
filtered by search criteria. These are extremely useful features that I use all
the time, but it's hard to face a busy day with all of your activities sorted
into separate lists with separate commands, so let's combine them.
</p>

<p>
To do this, we will use an “agenda custom command.”
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org70ba346" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="agenda-custom-commands"><a id="org70ba346"></a>Agenda Custom Commands</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-agenda-custom-commands">
<p>
An “agenda custom command” allows you to add your own entries to the dispatch
menu and, in effect, define your own agenda view that you can trigger easily. To
define custom agenda commands, you customize the variable
<code>org-agenda-custom-commands</code>.
</p>

<p>
In its simplest form, an agenda command looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
 '(("c" "Simple agenda view" agenda ""))
</pre>

<p>
Note that <code>org-agenda-custom-commands</code> is itself a list, so its value here is a
list with one element, which is also a list. That inner list is our custom
command; it has a single letter key that will appear in the menu (“c”), a
description that will also appear, and then a type.
</p>

<p>
There are many types available and some can accept arguments. Types and their
arguments are given one after another. In this case, the “agenda” type takes no
arguments and the documentation specifies that the empty string must be given.
</p>

<p>
OK, so this is great and all, but all we've actually done is recreate the “a”
option with the letter “c” instead. That isn't very helpful.
</p>

<p>
The goal is to be able to see our scheduled items <b>and</b> our unscheduled items
in the same view. Fortunately, there is a feature for this (of course), and it
is called a “composite agenda” or “agenda block view.”
</p>

<p>
Essentially, by supplying a list of types, the agenda view will generate each
one in turn and display them in the same buffer together! This is one of the
greatest things I've ever discovered. I lived for months scheduling things to
start “today” just so they would show up in the agenda, even though dates were
irrelevant. Since discovering this view, I now have a much more nuanced
perspective on my priorities.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgea1182a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="building-the-composite-agenda-view"><a id="orgea1182a"></a>Building the Composite Agenda View</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-building-the-composite-agenda-view">
<p>
As I mentioned above, all you need to do is build a list of types within your
custom agenda command. Here is a simple one that will display your scheduled
items followed by all of your TODO items:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
 '(("c" "Simple agenda view"
 ((agenda "")
 (alltodo "")))))
</pre>

<p>
A couple of things are going on here that deserve some explanation:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you build a composite agenda, the types are a list and each type becomes
its own list, so you will note that <code>(agenda "")</code> and <code>(alltodo "")</code> now have
parentheses around them. That is a requirement and will not work otherwise.</li>
<li><code>alltodo</code> is a type that is only available in a composite agenda; it will not
work in a single custom agenda command, instead you should use <code>todo</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When you run this, you will see your scheduled items at the top, a divider line
made up of equal signs, and all of your other TODO items at the bottom, like this:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="file:///images/uploads/an-agenda-for-life-with-org-mode/composite-1.png" alt="composite-1.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
We are already much closer now to our goal of visualizing all of our activities
in one place. This covers scheduled items, deadline items, and “eventually”
items, but it doesn't help us to see what we should do next. For that, I use
prioritization.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1b85de2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="priorities-and-focusing-your-day"><a id="org1b85de2"></a>Priorities, and Focusing Your Day</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-priorities-and-focusing-your-day">
<p>
Org Mode already has a notion of “priority,” and you can mark each item with a
priority “cookie” by calling <code>org-priority</code>, <code>org-priority-up</code>, or
<code>org-priority-down</code>. It is possible to sort TODO lists by priority, so it may be
enough for you to see the higher priority items at the top of your “eventually”
list, and to pick away at those, perhaps re-prioritizing other things as you go
along.
</p>

<p>
I do continuously re-prioritize, but I also subscribe to a GTD approach that
Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen wrote about, which is to take some time at
the end of the day to pick the three things you will do the following day. I
really liked that idea, so I wanted to make it more formal in my agenda view.
</p>

<p>
I decided to use priority “A” items as “things I must do today,” and let the
other priorities act as simple differentiators for the remaining “eventually”
items so that I can at least pay closer attention to things I determined to care
more about (and ignore things that are not as important, which is what I use
priority “C” for).
</p>

<p>
To achieve this, I did two things:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I placed a TODO section at the top of my composite agenda view that displays
<b>only</b> priority “A” items, and</li>
<li>I filtered priority “A” items out of the “eventually” list so that I see them
only once.</li>
</ol>

<p>
There is occasionally duplication across the scheduled section of the view, but
I haven't come up with the best way to handle that yet. My goal is to keep the
scheduled section as short as possible, and very few of my activities are
actually time-sensitive in a formal sense, but when I tell someone I will get
back to them by X date, I use that function to ensure that I will remember to do
so.
</p>

<p>
The first part of the solution is easy, the second part was not so easy.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf752dbc" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="the-top-priority-section"><a id="orgf752dbc"></a>The Top Priority Section</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-the-top-priority-section">
<p>
As it turns out, certain properties of Org entries can be treated as special
“tags” and filtered using the tags filtering options in the agenda custom
commands and composite view types. In this case, we want to see only items with
a priority of “A”, and so we can use the tag <code>PRIORITY</code>"A"= to achieve that.
</p>

<p>
Here is what that configuration looks like:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
 '(("c" "Simple agenda view"
 ((tags "PRIORITY=\"A\""
 ((org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo 'done))
 (org-agenda-overriding-header "High-priority unfinished tasks:")))
 (agenda "")
 (alltodo "")))))
</pre>

<p>
A few things to note here:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You actually have to quote the value of the priority tag, but the tag
selector is quoted itself so you wind up with some yucky escaping
backslashes. Such is life. It won't work if you don't quote the value.</li>
<li>This example introduces the local settings list, which is a <code>let</code>-style
list of Org configuration variables and their values that will be applied
only during the generation of that section of the composite view. In this
case, I am setting the value of <code>org-agenda-skip-function</code> and
<code>org-agenda-overriding-header</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The <code>org-agenda-skip-function</code> is one of the coolest ideas; it allows you to
specify a function that will be called on each entry and the function can either
return <code>nil</code> to display that entry, or return a character location to skip
to. This allows you to skip a single entry or even an entire subtree if some
criteria applies.
</p>

<p>
I am using it here to skip all entries that are already marked DONE, because
once something is DONE, I don't need to work on it anymore and I don't want to
see it in my list. <code>org-agenda-skip-entry-if</code> is a function provided for use in
these kinds of cases and I recommend reading its documentation for more details.
</p>

<p>
The <code>org-agenda-overriding-header</code> does what it sounds like: it changes the
header line of this agenda section to the string specified. Here's what it all
looks like together:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="file:///images/uploads/an-agenda-for-life-with-org-mode/composite-2.png" alt="composite-2.png" />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org473ec85" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="filtering-the-eventually-list"><a id="org473ec85"></a>Filtering the “Eventually” List</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-filtering-the-eventually-list">
<p>
Great, so now you have a section at the top for the stuff you want to do
immediately, a section showing a time-based view of what you need to accomplish
soon, and a list of all the other items on your TODO list (your “eventually”
items).
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, your “eventually” list now also contains the high-priority items
shown at the top, which is redundant and distracting. Let's filter priority “A”
items out of this list.
</p>

<p>
I was optimistic that Org shipped with some skip function to skip over
priorities, but it doesn't. Oh well, time to write some elisp. Here's what I
came up with:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun air-org-skip-subtree-if-priority (priority)
 "Skip an agenda subtree if it has a priority of PRIORITY.

PRIORITY may be one of the characters ?A, ?B, or ?C."
 (let ((subtree-end (save-excursion (org-end-of-subtree t)))
 (pri-value (* 1000 (- org-lowest-priority priority)))
 (pri-current (org-get-priority (thing-at-point 'line t))))
 (if (= pri-value pri-current)
 subtree-end
 nil)))
</pre>

<p>
As always, note that <code>air</code> is simply a “namespace prefix” to ensure uniqueness
of the function name.
</p>

<p>
The way priorities work internally is clever; the “lowest priority” is the upper
bounding ASCII value of the letters used, such that the difference of that value
and the entry's priority letter value multiplied by 1,000 is the numeric
priority.
</p>

<p>
The default “lowest priority” value is 67, and the ASCII value of “A” is 65, so
the numeric value of priority “A” is 2,000, “B” (ASCII value 66) is 1,000, and
“C” (ASCII value 67) is 0.
</p>

<p>
For whatever reason, there are no internal Org functions to easily extract just
the priority letter, but I wanted my function to accept the letter rather than
the numeric value so I just convert that to its corresponding number and use
<code>org-get-priority</code> to compare the entry's value to the given one.
</p>

<p>
For this one, I always skip the whole subtree. It hasn't bitten me yet, but it
is pretty easy to pivot it to skip only the current entry, or even provide an
option, so I might do that if I find out I'm missing something.
</p>

<p>
Let's apply this to our configuration:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
 '(("c" "Simple agenda view"
 ((tags "PRIORITY=\"A\""
 ((org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo 'done))
 (org-agenda-overriding-header "High-priority unfinished tasks:")))
 (agenda "")
 (alltodo ""
 ((org-agenda-skip-function
 '(or (air-org-skip-subtree-if-priority ?A)
 (org-agenda-skip-if nil '(scheduled deadline))))))))))
</pre>

<p>
There are two changes here. First, I'm calling my new function to skip priority
“A” items. I also noticed that the “eventually” list contained items with
scheduled or deadline dates, which should appear in the middle section when
appropriate, so I filtered those out as well. Here's what it looks like:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="file:///images/uploads/an-agenda-for-life-with-org-mode/composite-3.png" alt="composite-3.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Note here that the skip function is a whole quoted lisp form that is evaluated
for each entry; it is not limited to a single function name. For this reason, it
is straightforward to create more complex logical rules without having to write
a function to encapsulate them. Here, I am using an <code>or</code> to check both criteria.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge6c602e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="finally-habits"><a id="orge6c602e"></a>Finally, Habits</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-finally-habits">
<p>
You may already know that Org Mode supports TODO items that repeat. There are a
few ways that repeating schedules can be specified, so I recommend
<a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Repeated-tasks.html">reading the full documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
One of the most powerful ways of tracking repeated tasks is by using
<b>habits</b>. A habit is something that you want to do on a regular basis, but
where you have flexibility in how regular the schedule is.
</p>

<p>
Here, again, you may want to review the
<a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html">full habits documentation</a>. The example used in the documentation
is remembering to shave. It is not critical that you shave on any single, exact
day, but it may be important to you to shave within a loose cadence with a
couple of days of leeway.
</p>

<p>
I use habits to track scheduling appointments like one-on-ones with my direct
reports. While it is very important that one-on-ones happen regularly, it is not
critical that they take place at exactly X days apart, and this gives me
flexibility to schedule more frequently with people who need more attention and
to work around my other appointments.
</p>

<p>
To create a habit, you need two things:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A <code>SCHEDULED</code> tag with a repeat specification (like <code>.+</code> or <code>++</code>), and</li>
<li>A <code>STYLE</code> property set to the value <code>habit</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here is the example from the documentation:
</p>

<pre class="example">
** TODO Shave
 SCHEDULED: &lt;2009-10-17 Sat .+2d/4d&gt;
 :PROPERTIES:
 :STYLE: habit
 :LAST_REPEAT: [2009-10-19 Mon 00:36]
 :END:
</pre>

<p>
The repeat specification, <code>.+2d/4d</code> means:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Repeat as frequently as every two days, but</li>
<li>Never less frequently than every four days, and</li>
<li>When completed, start counting again from <b>today</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you use <code>++</code> instead of <code>.+</code> it means “from the last date completed, count as
many 2-day intervals as necessary to find a date in the future.” This is useful
if you want something to always fall on the same days of the week, for example.
</p>

<p>
You can use a plain <code>+</code> repeat, which is unusual for a habit, because if you
fall quite behind you will need to complete the task as many times as it takes
for the next occurrence to get into the future. This would be useful for
something like paying your rent where you cannot skip any instances, but that
isn't really a habit, now is it?
</p>

<p>
I love habits, but now we have another problem... Habits appear with the
blue/green/red bar as shown in the screenshot at the top of this post when they
are listed in a daily or weekly agenda view, but because they are also regular
scheduled items, they appear in our “eventually” list with a lot less useful
detail.
</p>

<p>
You know what time it is. Filtering time.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org074f641" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="filtering-habits"><a id="org074f641"></a>Filtering Habits</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-filtering-habits">
<p>
Again I was really optimistic that Org provided some built-in function for
filtering by style or property... But it doesn't. So here's my implementation of
a habit-skipping function:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun air-org-skip-subtree-if-habit ()
 "Skip an agenda entry if it has a STYLE property equal to \"habit\"."
 (let ((subtree-end (save-excursion (org-end-of-subtree t))))
 (if (string= (org-entry-get nil "STYLE") "habit")
 subtree-end
 nil)))
</pre>

<p>
Org does provide helper functions for extracting property values and finding
locations relative to entries, so it was straightforward to write this. It would
be easy enough to parameterize the property value if you wanted to skip
different types of properties, but I don't have that use case (yet).
</p>

<p>
There are just a couple of things in here that I haven't mentioned specifically,
so let me do that.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Both TODO sections use <code>org-agenda-overriding-header</code>, which I previously
described.</li>
<li>The “agenda” section in the middle also specifies <code>org-agenda-ndays</code> with a
value of 1, because I only want to see one day at a time. If you have been
coding along with this you might have wondered how to get rid of all the
other days of the week... This is how.</li>
<li>There is a final settings list at the end containing
<code>org-agenda-compact-blocks</code>. Settings in this list apply to the entire
composite view, and this setting removes the equal sign dividers between the
sections, because I think they're a waste of space.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Congratulations, you now probably know more about building Org Mode agenda
commands and composite views than most people. I hope that these tools give you
the ability to confidently tackle the tasks in your life and give you a sense of
peace.

The agenda view is pretty amazing, and it's very useful as a read-only overview
of what you need to get done, but the journey doesn't stop there because the
agenda is also completely interactive.
</p>

<p>
I've tweaked my configuration to make the agenda view easy to navigate and
interact with, optimized for my common use cases, and I'm going to get into that
in depth in my next post, so stay tuned!
