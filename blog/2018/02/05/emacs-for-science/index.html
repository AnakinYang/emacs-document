<h1 class="title">Emacs for Science</h1>
<p>
I typically cover software packages that do actual calculations to advance scientific
knowledge, but here I'm exploring a slightly stranger tool in the arsenal of scientific
computation. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">Emacs</a> is a text editor that has almost all the functionality of an operating system. A
collection of enhancements and configuration settings are available bundled under the name
of <a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax">scimax</a>. Being an Emacs user myself, I was surprised I'd never heard of it before now. This
project has been in development for some time, but it recently has started to find wider
attention. 
</p>

<p>
Before installing it, however, you need to install the latest version of Emacs to get all of the
needed functionality. As with most of my articles, I am assuming that you are using a
Debian-based distribution. You can install Emacs by using the daily snapshot package,
available at the official launchpad archive. Install it with the following commands: 
</p>


<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-elisp/ppa
sudo update
sudo install emacs-snapshot
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This will ensure that you have the latest and greatest version. 
</p>

<p>
Once this is installed, go ahead and install the scimax code itself. You can get it from the
main GitHub repository with the command: 
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">git clone https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax.git
</pre>
</div>


<p>
Start it with the command: 
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">emacs-snapshot -q -l path/to/scimax/init.el
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The first time you do this, there will be a lot of activity while Emacs downloads and installs
the full suite of extra packages you need in order for the scimax code to have all of the
required dependencies. 
</p>

<p>
When you finally have everything installed and start scimax, you will see several new menu
items in your Emacs session. 
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/ufiles/imagecache/large-550px-centered/u1000009/12213scif1.png" alt="12213scif1.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Figure 1. You will see several new menu item entries at the top of your Emacs window. 
</p>

<p>
The real driving need behind all of the work that has gone into scimax is to make research
more easily reproducible and to handle documentation of your research with minimal extra
overhead. 
</p>

<p>
Since you want to work with organized documents within Emacs, the base of scimax is built
on top of <a href="http://orgmode.org">org-mode</a>. Org-mode, by itself, is probably something you will want to look into as
a potent tool. Scimax takes this powerful core and makes it easier to use with a series of
shortcuts. 
</p>

<p>
Because of org-mode's power, it would be time well spent if you learned at least the basics
of how to use the main parts of this package. Org-mode has a markup syntax of its own, and
scimax adds a layer of shortcuts that make it easier to write. 
</p>

<p>
Along with the regular org-mode markup syntax, scimax makes it easier to include LaTeX
sections for more advanced textual layout. Many people in scientific fields are familiar with
LaTeX. For those who aren't, LaTeX is document layout program where you write your text
and include layout instructions for the LaTeX engine. The idea is that you separate out the
text from the formatting of that text. 
</p>

<p>
If you have graphical images as part of your research, scimax has added some extra
functionality to make image rescaling and presentation better than the org-mode defaults by
using external programs from the imagemagick package. 
</p>

<p>
Because org-mode is designed to be a document structuring package for Emacs, it allows for
exporting your text into a great many other formats. Also, since it separates out the
formatting from the actual text, it can be applied to many different document structures,
such as articles, books or web pages. 
</p>

<p>
Scimax uses the ox-manuscript Emacs package to handle exporting to high-quality
document formats. This is useful when you need to produce final versions of your scientific
reports or articles in a format like PDF. 
</p>

<p>
Bibliographic references within your document are handled through bibtex entries. 
</p>

<p>
So far, I've covered a quick overview of the document management, organization and
formatting tools that are provided through scimax, but Emacs and org-mode have much
more functionality. You can interact with the outside world in a few different ways. The first is
through email. You can grab selections of your text, or an entire buffer, and issue an
org-mime command within Emacs to tell it to send an HTML-based email. Depending on your
system, you may need additional configuration in order for this to work as expected. 
</p>

<p>
The other way to interact with the outside world is through Google searches. As someone
who writes a fair bit myself, I cannot understate the need for a Google window to be open to
be able to verify some fact or statement as I am writing. With scimax, the google-this Emacs
package gets installed and is available as you are working. This allows you to fire up Google
searches based on either specific text selections or the contents of entire buffers
immediately from the document that you are working on. 
</p>

<p>
Along with communicating with the outside world, the other powerful interaction with
external tools is through org-mode's ability to run external programs and have their output
inserted into sections of your document. This one piece of functionality makes the dream of
reproducible research a real possibility. You do need to be diligent and put it into practice,
but you no longer have the excuse of saying that it isn't possible. The idea is that, from
within your org-mode document, you can define a block of code that makes some calculation
or generates some graph. You then can have org-mode fire this block so that it can be run
through an external engine and have the results pulled back in and inserted as the
displayed text in the original location. 
</p>

<p>
The default engine configured in scimax is Python, which is definitely a good starting point.
With more configuration, you can add support for several other languages. The powerful idea
here is that you always can go back to the original code that generated some result or some
graph and re-create it. More and more scientific journals are demanding this level of
reproducibility, so having it as part of your article contents directly means you never will lose
track of it. 
</p>

<p>
The last thing I want to cover is how to organize all of the work that scimax is helping you
do. The highest level of organization is the ability to set up projects. A project is essentially a
directory with all of the associated files for that given project. These projects are handled by
the Emacs projectile package. This package allows you to move between projects, find files
within projects or do full searches through a given project. 
</p>

<p>
Projectile assumes that these project directories are under some kind of version control
system, such as Git. Luckily, scimax includes the magit Emacs package, which adds lots of
extra functions that allow you to interact with the Git repository that the current file belongs
to directly from Emacs. You can create or clone repositories, stage and commit changes,
manage diffs between versions, and even handle pushes to and pulls from remote
repositories. Along with the explicit control over a Git repository, scimax includes extensions
to org-mode to handle track changes, as well as to insert edit marks within your org-mode
document. 
</p>

<p>
Putting all of this organizational work together, scimax provides the ability to create and use
scientific notebooks. A series of commands starting with nb- allow you to wrap all of the
organizational functionality to create, manage and archive these notebooks. Now, you have
no reason not to start documenting all of your scientific research in a reproducible
way—except maybe the learning curve. But, as the old saying goes, nothing worth doing is
easy, and I think this is definitely worth doing, at least for some people.
