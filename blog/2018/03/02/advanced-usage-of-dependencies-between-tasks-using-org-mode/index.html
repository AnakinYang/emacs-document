This blog article is for advanced users of <a href="../../../../tags/emacs">Emacs</a> <a href="http://orgmode.org">org-mode</a> and people who are curious how non-trivial todo management can be accomplished using those tools.
</p>

<p>
Defining dependencies between todo tasks is done via the contribution package <code>org-depend.el</code>. It offers a nice set of features. However, I do only use a sub-set for my workflows. Therefore, this article is not an exhaustive description of <code>org-depend.el</code> but it gives ideas on how to use and improve it.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org504e648" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="advanced-snippets-with-yasnippet-and-yankpad"><a id="org504e648"></a>Advanced Snippets With yasnippet and yankpad</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-advanced-snippets-with-yasnippet-and-yankpad">
<p>
For a one-time workflow, I create the tasks and define dependencies manually. However, when I have to do things multiple times, I tend to use a <a href="../../../../apps-I-am-using">snippet software</a> which inserts the headings and tasks on a keyboard shortcut. I wrote a <a href="../../../../Textbausteine">German blog article on text snippet tools</a>.
</p>

<p>
A simple static snippet is for example <code>ccn</code> <code>TAB</code> which inserts my credit card number. A simple dynamic snippet is <code>dd</code> <code>TAB</code> which inserts the current day in ISO format such as <code>2016-12-17</code>. For a complex workflow as described further down, you'll need a snippet tool which delivers also complex, interactive snippets.
</p>

<p>
For using simple to very advanced Emacs snippets there is <a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet">yasnippet</a>. With yasnippet, you are managing your snippets in separate files in directories according to your major modes such as org-mode. Invoking a snippet is done by typing the defined short abbreviation of the snippet (such as <code>dd</code>) followed by typically the <code>TAB</code> key.
</p>

<p>
I was using yasnippet for many years when I found <a href="https://github.com/Kungsgeten/yankpad">yankpad</a> which is a wrapper for yasnippet. In contrast to yasnippet, yankpad manages snippets in an Org-mode file as separate headings (in contrast to files in directories). Since most of my snippets are for Org-mode, I happily embraced yankpad and switched all of my Org-mode snippets to it. This makes the maintenance more easy because I have the full feature set of org-mode while writing snippets.
</p>

<p>
With such a capable snippet system, I define complex workflows only once without having to cope with dependence definitions when I create an instance of this workflow. Therefore, for workflows I am using regularly, complexity is put into the snippet template which I am able to benefit instantly.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-example-use-case-organizing-an-cabaret-evening-with-friends">
<p>
I love going to cabaret events with my friends. To minimize the organization effort without forgetting something important, I maintain a simple workflow:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Basic information on the event: artist, date, short description, ...</li>
<li>Make reservations for the tickets</li>
<li>Send out an email to my friends asking who is joining</li>
<li>Write down everyone who is joining us</li>
<li>Send out a reminder email shortly before the event so no one forgets</li>
<li>Create an org-mode event for the event evening itself</li>
</ol>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-using-an-advanced-interactive-snippet">
<p>
Let's assume, I stumbled over an news paper article of one of my favorite artists coming to town.
</p>

<p>
I switch to my org-mode file which contains such events. I invoke the keyboard sequence to insert a yankpad snippet and then choose the snippet for cabaret. Emacs asks me the day of the event (using a date picker), the name of the artist, the name of the cabaret program, the location (choosing from a pre-defined list of venues), how many seats I am going to reserve, the date of the first and second email.
</p>

<p>
My yankpad snippet looks like below. You also need my simple wrapper functions for asking and inserting stuff: <code>my-capture-prompt</code>, <code>my-capture-selection</code>, and <code>my-capture-insert</code> which can be found in <a href="https://github.com/novoid/dot-emacs/blob/master/main.el">my Emacs setup</a>.

Applying the snippet and creating an instance will result in something like this:

</pre>

<p>
Notice that with multiple cabaret events on different dates, the IDs are still unique due to the event date being part of it and all dependencies are pre-defined accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Once the reservation is acknowledged and its task is marked as done, the two tasks for sending out the emails get their "TODO" status via <code>:TRIGGER:</code>.
</p>

<p>
Update 2017-11-23: the propagation of the status keyword <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2017-11/msg00260.html">does not work for some cases</a>.
</p>

<p>
To demonstrate a blocking precondition, I added a <code>:BLOCKER:</code> dependency for the reminder email task which is a bit redundant in this particular example. There is a subtle additional difference with the <code>:BLOCKER:</code> heading as well: as long as the blocking ID is not marked as done (or canceled), the <code>:BLOCKER:</code> task does not get on my agenda. This is awesome because I don't see already defined and scheduled tasks as long as the pre-condition is not met. Therefore, I always define <code>:TRIGGER:</code> and <code>:BLOCKER:</code> dependencies in my workflows in order to keep my agenda not messed up with todos I am not able to do now.
</p>

<p>
Defining a complex snippet takes time and effort. Although once you have defined a complex snippet for a workflow, the beauty is that a workflow instance can be easily set-up for many times.
</p>

<h2 id="advanced-workflows"><a id="orgd13f6ec"></a>Advanced Workflows</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-advanced-workflows">
<p>
The cabaret example is a rather simple one just to demonstrate the basic idea. Much more complex workflows I use are project templates, eBay-purchase workflow, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29">Scrum</a> stories management, and even whole lecture management for an entire term including exam preparation and student grading that consists of dozens of headings.
</p>

<p>
Additional to the <code>:TRIGGER:</code> and <code>:BLOCKER:</code> dependencies I was using in my snippet, <code>org-depend.el</code> offers other features as well. With <code>chain-siblings(KEYWORD)</code> the next heading gets the status <code>KEYWORD</code> when the current heading gets marked as done. Then there is <code>chain-siblings-scheduled</code> which moves on the SCHEDULED date to the next heading as well. <code>chain-find-next(KEYWORD[,OPTIONS])</code> helps you finding the "next" heading.
</p>

<p>
Although those are nifty features, I don't use them because I would need even more elaborate features which I discuss in the following sections.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-room-for-improvements">
<p>
Since I am a power-user of <code>org-depend.el</code> and <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2016-12/msg00236.html">Carsten asked for ideas on improving <code>org-depend.el</code></a> I wrote down some possible improvements that would ease my personal digital life.
</p>

<p>
Some of them are probably solved with a few lines of Elisp code. Unfortunately, I am very bad at coding Elisp myself and thus can't extend Emacs the way I would love to.

<h3 id="improvement-id-picker"><a id="org1b79003"></a>Improvement: ID Picker</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-improvement-id-picker">
<p>
First of all, I'd like to see some kind of ID picker when defining <code>:TRIGGER:</code> and <code>:BLOCKER:</code> dependencies.
</p>

<p>
This should work like this: after setting up the task in headings and giving them IDs, I'd like to invoke a "I want to define a dependency"-command. It first asks me what property I want to set: <code>:TRIGGER:</code> or <code>:BLOCKER:</code>.
</p>

<p>
Then I get asked to select any ID which could be found within the same sub-hierarchy (or even in all files?).
</p>

<p>
After being asked for the KEYWORD to be set for <code>:TRIGGER:</code> dependencies (if applicable), the property is added to the current heading accordingly.
</p>

<p>
This would drastically improve creating dependency definitions and prevent typing errors in the first place.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-improvement-generating-ids-from-heading-and-date">
<p>
So far, I define <code>:ID:</code> properties manually. There are settings that result in random IDs set for any new heading. I don't like random ID numbers because I would like to get a hint what heading this might be when I see it.
</p>

<p>
Usually, my IDs start with the current ISO day to enforce uniqueness and look like this:
</p>

<p>
<b>Title</b>
<b>Manual ID</b>
Update notebook
2016-12-18-update-notebook
Schedule a meeting with Bob
2016-12-18-schedule-meeting-bob
Add additional URLs to lecture notes
2016-12-18-add-URLs-to-lecture
</p>

<p>
Wouldn't it be nice when there is a command which takes the current heading title and auto-generates the ID property accordingly? I guess this is not that hard to do:
</p>

This is an idea that Christophe Schockaert <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2016-12/msg00251.html">wrote on the mailinglist</a>: Why not having an assistant which does multiple things at once?

I can copy that: this is a very common set of operations which are done together. However, I personally would like to have the previously mentioned functions above <b>in addition</b> to this assistant.

<p>
I love the <code>:TRIGGER:</code> property because I can mark headings as open tasks only if they can be done now. Only headings which are ready to be looked at do have the <code>TODO</code> keyword.
</p>

<p>
One limitation of <code>org-depend.el</code> is that I am only to move forward scheduled dates to siblings and I am not able to define a different scheduled date.
</p>

<p>
Assume following syntax:

:END:   
</pre>

<p>
I extended the option of the trigger property so that I added an ISO date to the keyword parameter.
</p>

<p>
What I'd expect is that on finishing the first task, the heading with the ID <code>2016-12-18-send-offer</code> not only gets the keyword <code>TODO</code> but also is scheduled for 2016-12-23 as well.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the send-offer heading is not necessarily located in the same sub-hierarchy as the ask-client heading. Therefore, sibling-operations are not the whole answer here.
</p>

<p>
Additional to this, I'd like to have the possibility to define relative schedule dates as stated in <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/The-date_002ftime-prompt.html#The-date_002ftime-prompt">manual for the date prompt</a>:
</p>

<p>
<code>2016-12-18-send-offer(TODO,.)</code>

<code>2016-12-18-send-offer(TODO,+3d)</code>
3 days after the scheduled date of the asking-task
<code>2016-12-18-send-offer(TODO,.+3d)</code>
3 days from the day when marking the asking-task as done
<code>2016-12-18-send-offer(TODO,mon)</code>

<code>2016-12-18-send-offer(TODO,+2tue)</code>

<p>
Wouldn't it be nice to have a general setting (or a property?) whether or not I want to handle canceled tasks differently as tasks marked as done?

<p>
Imagine the example from above. Does it really make sense to send an offer when I canceled the ask-client task? Many people probably would love to cancel all follow-up workflow tasks as well.

While most people do not need advanced workflow management, such as dependencies between tasks, I do love this Org-mode feature. It was the reason I started with Org-mode in the first place. I love that my agenda only shows tasks which can be done <b>now</b> and whose dependencies are already met.

So even when you did not feel the urge to define your workflows with a snippet/template system you might enjoyed this article. Maybe you are going to start defining simple workflows as well.

I'd love to read your comments on snippets, workflows, dependencies and such: write me an email or commend via Disqus (see below).

As an alternative to org-depend, I was recommended to take a look at <a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/org-edna.html">org-edna</a>. From the first impression, it is quite similar to org-depend but different. It is more complex and allows more advanced definitions of dependencies. I am looking forward to testing org-edna and I'll blog about it.
