The VC package provides to user ability to work with different version control systems
(VCS) via unified user interfaces. Now it supports following VCS (via VCS-specific
modules): rcs, CVS, MetaCVS, Subversion, GNU Arch, sccs, Darcs, SourceSafe, ClearCase, Git
and Mercurial (some of them available only in GNU Emacs 22.0, development repository of
GNU Emacs or at author's sites).
</p>

<h2 id="basic-concepts-and-approaches"><a id="org07d1fbb"></a><a id="org8d2370c"></a> Basic concepts and approaches</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-basic-concepts-and-approaches">
<p>
Design of VC package took many things from the design of rcs version control system. So
many concepts tightly coupled with concepts of this VCS.
</p>

<p>
When file is under control of VCS, then we say that it "registered" in VCS. For each file
exists "main" file, that contain data and history of changes. For each "main" file could
exists "work" file, that could be modified. In some VCS you need to block work file
before add any change. In other VCS you can add changes to your copy of work file, and
than explicitly commit changes to repository. For systems, that require explicit locking
of files, to add a change to a file, you need to switch file from read-only state to
read-write state. And usually, in such systems, only one user can make changes into
locked files, and other users should wait until that user finish modification of files and
remove block on file(s).
</p>

<p>
When you work with VC some information about its state is displayed in status line.
Information is represented in following form: at first is short name of VCS, used for
current file, next is displayed symbol, describing file's state, and then file's version
number is displayed. If state symbol is equal to <code>-</code>, then file is not blocked or changed.
If file is blocked or modified, then symbol is changed to <code>:</code>. If file is blocked by other
user, then status field will displayed as <code>:user:</code>.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-basic-work-sequence">
<p>
The main function of VC package is <code>vc-next-action</code> (<code>C-x v v</code>), that performs next logical
command of version control system. Depending on used VCS, order of commands in this
sequence could differ. For systems, that require blocking of file (rcs, sccs, and CVS
with corresponding setup), order of executions is following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if file is not registered in VCS, then register it;</li>
<li>if file is registered, but not blocked, then fetch latest version from repository and
block it;</li>
<li>if file was blocked by current user, but not changed, then it fetches new version and
updates buffer;</li>
<li>if file was changed, then display a new buffer to enter comment about change, and
commit changes;</li>
<li>if file was blocked by other user, then VC tries to block it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For systems, that doesn't support explicit blocking, order of execution is slightly different:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if file is not registered in VCS, then register it, but doesn't commit it;</li>
<li>if file already was added, but not committed, then commit it;</li>
<li>if file was changed, then display a new buffer to enter comment about change, and
commit changes;</li>
<li>if file was changed in repository, then ask user, and perform merging of changes in
your copy of work file.</li>
</ul>

<p>
User can pass prefix argument to <code>vc-next-action</code> function. Passing of this argument allow
user to change behaviour of function --- for example, user can set version number for new
file, or for file, that will fetched from repository, or change version control system (if
file was registered in different VCS).
</p>

<p>
Entering of commit message is performed in special buffer with name <code>*VC-Log*</code>. User can
enter message, and commit changes by pressing <code>C-c C-c</code>. If you doesn't want to commit
changes, just leave this buffer without pressing <code>C-c C-c</code>. And if you want use same commit
message for several files, then you can use <code>M-n</code>, <code>M-p</code>, <code>M-s</code> and <code>M-r</code> key bindings, that allow
you to navigate in messages history.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-work-with-changes">
<p>
User can use VC to view changes, that he did during work with files. To get list of
changes between work copy and latest committed version, user can use <code>vc-diff</code> function
(<code>C-x v =</code>). If user runs this function with prefix argument, then he can
obtain list of changes between any two versions. The <code>vc-version-other-window</code> function (<code>C-x v ~</code>) allows to get from repository any version of file, and show it in separate buffer.
In some VCS you can obtain annotated versions of files, and VC also support this feature
with <code>vc-annotate</code> function, that bound to <code>C-x v g</code>. With annotated version you can see who
make concrete changes, in which version they was made, etc.
</p>

<p>
User can cancel with <code>vc-revert-buffer</code> function (<code>C-x v u</code>), that remove changes and return
current file to actual version from repository. After execution of <code>vc-revert-buffer</code> file
is not blocked, so you need to block it to make new changes.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="work-with-files"><a id="org0daa6a7"></a><a id="orga2340a0"></a> Work with files</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-work-with-files">
<p>
Registration of file in repository is performed with <code>vc-register</code> function (<code>C-x v i</code>).
Selection of version control systems depends on several parameters. If in the directory
there are files, already registered in some VCSs, then file will registered in this
system. If in directory there are files, registered in several VCSs, then file will
registered in system, that is first in the list <code>vc-handled-backends</code>. And if there are no
registered files in directory, then VC take first name from <code>vc-handled-backends</code> list. For
example, you can register file in CVS only if you explicitly specify name of VCS. By
default, new file gets version number equal 1.1. You can set another version number if
you supply prefix argument to <code>vc-register</code> function. If <code>vc-initial-comment</code> variable has
non-<code>nil</code> value, then this function also ask user for comment, that will used as description
of this file.
</p>

<p>
The VC package also supports renaming of registered files. To do this you can use
<code>vc-rename-file</code> function, that renames you working file, and also "main" file. This
function also update all snapshots, so they will point to the correct file name. But you
couldn't use this function for blocked files.
</p>

<p>
User can also get information about current file by using <code>vc-print-log</code> function, that
bound to <code>C-x v l</code>. This command shows history of changes together with text of comments
for each of change.
</p>

<h3 id="use-vc-together-with-dired"><a id="orgf83310e"></a><a id="org19776cc"></a> Use VC together with Dired</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-use-vc-together-with-dired">
<p>
Functions, that was described before, was designed to work with separate files. But for
big projects it's often need to work with sets of files --- see which files was modified,
display list of changes for whole project, etc. To allow user to do this, VC package
implements special mode ---
<code>vc-dired-mode</code>. To create a buffer, that work in this mode,
user could use <code>vc-directory</code> function (<code>C-x v d</code>). The buffer, created by this command, has
almost no differs from usual Dired's buffer. In this buffer user can see recursive list
of files, registered in VCS.
</p>

<p>
During work with Dired's buffer we can display data in short or full mode. In short
display mode, in buffer are displayed only modified or not updated files. In full display
mode, in buffer are displayed all files registered in VCS. User can switch between short
and full display modes with <code>v t</code> key binding. In buffer also displayed information about
user, who had blocked file (for systems, that support this feature) or file status (for
all other systems). In the buffer with <code>vc-dired-mode</code> work all Dired's functions and keys,
except <code>v</code> key, that is used as prefix key for all VC functions. For user available all VC
functions, as described in other section, but they doesn't use <code>C-x</code> prefix, and could be
applied for file sets.
</p>

<h3 id="work-with-branches"><a id="orgb6f9948"></a><a id="org0cf94c5"></a> <a id="orgd4ff7bf"></a>Work with branches</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-work-with-branches">
<p>
Like other packages, that allows to work with VCS, the VC package also supports work with
different branches of one project. Package supports creation of branches, switching
between them, and also merging of changes between different branches. To switch to other
branch you just need to supply prefix argument to the <code>vc-next-action</code> function. User may
use branch version instead of concrete version of file. Next operations will performed on
selected branch. Creation of new branch is performed similar way --- when you commit data
with <code>vc-next-action</code>, you just need to supply prefix argument and version number. If you
supply non-existing branch number, then it will created. After creation of the branch,
all work will performed in it, and user will need to explicitly switch to other branch, if
he need this.
</p>

<p>
To merge changes from another branch you can use <code>vc-merge</code> function, that bound to <code>C-x v m</code>.
This command will ask you about branch from which you want merge changes, and apply them
to your current brunch. If you doesn't specify branch version, then changes will taken
from repository, from your current branch, if somebody commit them during your work. If
during merge arise some conflicts, then package will notify you, and mark them in the
file, or run Ediff to resolve them. You can also use <code>vc-resolve-conflicts</code> function to
resolve existing conflicts. This function run new Ediff session, where you can see all
conflicts, and accept or cancel proposed solutions.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-work-with-remote-repositories">
<p>
Some of VCS supports "central repository" concept, that is used to keep "main" versions of
file, together with history of changes. Repository could be local, or located on remote
server. VC automatically detects cases, when repository is located on remote server, and
does some things, that allow to effectively work with data, especially if connection to
server is very slow or unstable. When user make a first change in file, the local copy of
original file is created. This allow to execute functions for getting reverting changes
without establishing network connection. File with original version has name
<code>FILE.~VERSION.~</code>. When you commit changes to repository, local copy of original file will
deleted. User can also manually create reserve copy of file using <code>vc-version-other-window</code>
function. Difference between these two copies is that automatic copy has additional <code>.</code>
char before <code>~</code>. Many VC functions can use both copies of file if their exists.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-work-with-snapshots">
<p>
Snapshot is named set of files with concrete versions, that could be used as separate
object. Some VCSs support this concept internally, so VC just use existing functionality.
For all other systems, VC implements this functionality, so snapshots will visible only if
VC package is used. To work with snapshots VC package provides two functions. The
<code>vc-create-snapshot</code> function (<code>C-x v s</code>) create a new snapshot using versions of files
existing in current directory (and all sub-directories). The <code>vc-retrieve-snapshot</code>
function (<code>C-x v r</code>) allows user to retrieve snapshot with given name. Many VC's functions
allow user to use snapshot's names as argument, instead of using version numbers. This is
especially useful when you look list of changes between two releases of program.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-other-functions">
<p>
Usually for files, registered in some VCS history of changes is kept for each file
separately. But in GNU projects, usually change logs are kept for whole project or on per
directory basis. To allow to work with such change logs, VC package implements
<code>vc-update-change-log</code> function (<code>C-x v a</code>), that updates common change log with change logs
for all modified files. When this command gets a prefix argument, then it can update
common change log with entries from concrete files.
</p>

<p>
You can also insert special headers into your files. These headers depends on concrete
VCS, and in some VCSs could be used for auxiliary goals. To insert such header, you can
use <code>vc-insert-headers</code> function (<code>C-x v h</code>). VC automatically selects header, suitable for
current VCS. All headers are kept in <code>vc-BACKEND-header</code> variables, so you can modify them
to allow insertion of your own headers.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-customization">
<p>
User can customize behaviour of VC package using standard Emacs's customization routines.
He just need to execute <code>M-x customize-group vc</code> to do this. Some of options, applicable
for all supported VCSs, but some are applicable only to concrete backends. Full
description of customization variables you can find in VC's manual.
